For example https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-detail.html https://www.census.gov/content/census/en/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-state-total.html Border Crossing Data https://explore.dot.gov/views/BorderCrossingData/Monthly?:isGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&amp;:embed=y Other appropriate and useful data set will be added in the project. Question of interests 1.Visualize the current available data 2.Self prediction Extract important features for predicting the number of covid-19 cases Summarize the important features with each state Evaluate the influence of important features for each state. 3. Nearby prediction Cluster the regions based on appropriate criterion Evaluate the situation of COVID-19 in each cluster Summarize the important features across different region/cluster Summarize the important features within each cluster/region Evaluate the influence of each state to nearby states
