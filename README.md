Remark: Other appropriate and useful data set will be added in the project. Question of interests 1.Visualize the current available data 

2.Self prediction 

2.1 Find important features for predicting the number of covid-19 cases 

2.2 Summarize the important features with each state 

2.3 Evaluate the influence of important features for each state. 

3.Nearby prediction 

3.1 Cluster the regions based on appropriate criterion 

3.2 Evaluate the situation of COVID-19 in each cluster 

3.3 Summarize the important features across different region/cluster 

3.4 Summarize the important features within each cluster/region 

3.5 Evaluate the influence of each state to nearby states
